# 03 - Mounting Options

## Goal
Pick a mounting approach that is:
- **safe** for airport operations,
- produces a **useful view**,
- **maintainable** over time,
- and **approved** by the people who control the site.

## Before you choose an option
This guide assumes you have already completed:
- **Guide 01 (Permission Packet)** - especially privacy expectations and written approval
- **Guide 02 (Location & Siting)** - especially the default camera view guidance and site survey scoring

If you haven’t done those yet, do them first. Mounting is the implementation step.

## Quick pick-your-path
Start here based on what you already have access to:

- If there’s an **existing pole/structure** you can use → go to **Option A**
- If there’s a **building** with a good view and permission → go to **Option B**
- If you need a **new permanent mount** → go to **Option C**
- If you want a **reversible pilot install** (or a trial) → go to **Option D**

## Option A - Existing pole or structure (often the easiest)
Use what’s already there, if it’s safe and permitted.

**Good fits:**
- an existing airport pole or mast (non-critical to operations)
- a light pole or sign structure (with approval)
- an existing windsock pole *only if* you can mount without affecting windsock behavior or creating a maintenance problem

**Pros**
- typically simpler and cheaper
- usually fewer construction steps
- often easier to remove later

**Cons**
- the best pole for views may not be available or safe to use
- power/internet may still be hard
- height/angles may be limited

**Checklist**
- Approved by the airport sponsor/manager (or the controlling tenant)
- Camera view meets the Guide 02 default view guidance
- Safe access for installation and maintenance (escort is OK; plan for it)
- Cables can be routed cleanly and safely

## Option B - Building mount (often best for power + internet)
Mount to a building (or a short mast attached to a building) when it provides a safe, useful view and easier power/internet.

**Good fits:**
- airport office / terminal building
- a hangar wall or roof edge (with explicit permission)
- an FBO or flight school building

**Pros**
- power and internet are often easiest here
- maintenance access is usually simpler
- often less exposed than a standalone pole

**Cons**
- roof work can be hazardous (use proper safety practices)
- may require coordination with multiple stakeholders (owner + tenant)

**Checklist**
- Confirm who controls the building and get written permission
- Confirm safe access for installation and ongoing maintenance
- Confirm where cables can enter and how they’ll be protected
- Confirm the final view is acceptable (Guide 02) and privacy expectations are met (Guide 01)

## Option C - Permanent ground mount (new pole / fixed installation)
This is the long-term approach when you need height, permanence, or a specific location that existing structures can’t provide.

**Pros**
- most flexible for getting the ideal view
- can be designed to look clean and professional
- best for long-term stability

**Cons**
- higher effort and cost
- may require formal review/notification depending on height and location
- requires a stronger maintenance plan

**What “permanent” should mean**
- engineered mounting hardware (not improvised)
- clear cable routing and weather protection
- a plan for grounding / surge protection
- documented ownership and maintenance responsibilities

**When to pause and ask for guidance**
- if this adds significant height
- if you’re unsure whether FAA airspace notification/review applies
- if the airport sponsor/manager wants a formal process

## Option D - Temporary ground mount (reversible / pilot install)
Best for trials, remote strips, or reversible installs. Temporary does **not** mean casual: it must still be safe, stable, and permitted.

**Examples**
- a weighted base with a vertical mast (designed to resist wind)
- a guyed temporary mast (only where allowed and safe)
- a portable enclosure + short mast for camera and network gear

**Pros**
- fast to deploy and remove
- good for trials (“prove the value”)
- easier to iterate on camera framing

**Cons**
- can be more vulnerable to wind, tampering, and shifting
- may need more frequent checks

## Practical mounting tips (non-technical)
- **Stability matters**: a vibrating mount makes images less useful.
- **Weather protection**: use outdoor-rated mounts and cable protection.
- **Label things**: a simple label helps future maintainers.
- **Make it serviceable**: avoid installs that require heroic effort to access.

## Decision (write it down)
