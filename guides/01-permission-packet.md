# 01 — Permission Packet

## Purpose (plain language)
To help promote safety for pilots and the aviation community, we are requesting permission to install **weather and runway observation equipment** at this airport and share the resulting information **freely** with the aviation community via AviationWX.org.

This is intended as **supplemental “what it looks like right now” information**. It does **not** replace official weather products, NOTAMs, or a formal briefing.

## What we’re asking permission to do
With written approval from the airport sponsor/owner (or their designated steward/manager), we would like to:
- install **1–4 still-image cameras** oriented to show runway/sky conditions
- install **one weather station** (or integrate existing local weather sources if available)
  - for best results, the wind sensor should have **unobstructed exposure**, ideally mounted **at the top of an approved pole/building/structure**
- publish updates typically every **1–15 minutes**
- maintain and, if needed, remove the equipment

## What this provides (benefit)
- A fast, simple view of current conditions that can support better **aeronautical decision making**
- A practical tool for “should I go to the airport yet?” and “should I divert / wait it out?” decisions
- Useful context when the airport has limited nearby weather coverage

## Privacy (direct and explicit)
Cameras are for **weather and runway observations**, not people.

**Rule of thumb:** whenever possible, aim cameras so they show only what a pilot could reasonably observe publicly at the airport while complying with all local privacy laws. Avoid capturing clear detail of:
- identifiable people
- private property or homes
- private buildings, offices, hangar interiors, or other sensitive areas

If an acceptable privacy-respecting view isn’t possible, we will choose a different location or not install.

## What this is (and isn’t)
### This is like a “PIREP-style” supplement
A **PIREP** is a *Pilot Report*: information shared by pilots about observed conditions (e.g., turbulence, icing, cloud tops/bases, visibility). PIREPs are valuable, but they are **not guaranteed** and should be used alongside official sources.

AviationWX.org is similar in spirit: it offers timely, real-world observation data, but it is **supplemental** and not a replacement for official sources or a formal preflight briefing.

### Not a security system
This equipment is for **weather and runway observations**, not security monitoring.

## Typical footprint and rough budget
A typical install is:
- 1–4 cameras + 1 weather station
- updates every 1–15 minutes

Budget can be as low as **~$500**, but **~$1,000** is a good average minimum to plan for when volunteer labor can install the equipment. (More robust or professional solutions can cost more.)

## Installation and maintenance expectations
To be successful, the project needs:
- a safe, approved location (Guide 02)
- a realistic plan for power + internet (Guides 05–06)
- a designated local contact for basic checks and occasional maintenance
- a plan to remove or relocate equipment if it’s no longer wanted or maintainable

## Safety and compliance
This project exists to improve safety. We will not install equipment that:
- creates a hazard to operations
- produces misleading or unreliable data
- lacks formal permission
- has no reasonable maintenance plan

We will coordinate placement with the airport sponsor/manager, and follow any required local processes.

## Open-source and non-lock-in
AviationWX.org is **open source**. Airports or local groups can choose to:
- participate in the shared AviationWX.org network, **or**
- self-host the same software and keep their equipment without being locked into a proprietary solution

The goal is to keep this resource **free to use** and sustainable over time.

## Liability and “non-promissory” language
This project is one of many small measures an airport or community can take to improve safety. It is not a guarantee of safety, and it does not replace official sources or pilot responsibility.

If helpful, this project can be discussed as a **risk-reduction effort** alongside other airport safety practices.
