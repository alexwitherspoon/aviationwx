# 02 — Location & Safety‑First Siting

## Goal
Choose locations that provide useful **runway + sky** cues **in one glance** and representative weather readings **without creating hazards**.
A “good” site is:
- safe for airport operations,
- maintainable,
- and produces data that pilots can trust.

If you can’t do those three things, **don’t install**.

**Success =** pilots can answer **what it looks like right now** and whether conditions are **trending better or worse**—quickly, in one glance.

## The siting workflow (pick-your-path friendly)
1) Get written permission (Guide 01)  
2) Identify **2–5 candidate locations**  
3) Walk the field with the airport sponsor/manager (or their delegate)  
4) Use the site survey checklist to score options  
   - For each candidate: take a photo in the intended direction and a photo of the mounting surface
5) Pick a primary location and a backup  
6) Decide mounting + power + internet based on what the chosen location can support

## Site survey checklist
Use the checklist at the bottom of this page to evaluate **2–5 candidate locations** before you mount anything.

**Note:** the scoring is intentionally **weighted toward view usefulness**—the view is the main reason the camera exists. Everything else supports whether that view is safe and sustainable.

## What “good views” means (plain language)
### Cameras
Your first camera should answer: **“What are conditions like right now?”**

If you have only **one camera**, the default recommendation is:
- Aim it **down the primary approach runway**
- Frame guideline: **~50% (or less) ground** and **~50% sky**
- Include **geographic reference points** (mountains/hills/ridges/landmarks) when possible to help approximate visibility distance and cloud height

This gives pilots both runway condition cues (wet/snow/standing water) and sky/visibility cues (fog layers, cloud base trends) in a single view.

**Avoid:**
- overly zoomed views that lose sky context
- framing with too much ground that crowds out the sky
- privacy-sensitive framing (see Guide 01)

If you have multiple cameras, a simple, pilot-friendly recipe is:
- **Camera 1 (default):** runway axis + ~50/50 sky
- **Camera 2 (optional):** wide sky / horizon landmarks (visibility & layers)
- **Camera 3 (optional):** runway surface close-in or known problem areas (e.g., flooding)
- **Camera 4 (optional):** anything uniquely helpful for that airport

Windsock visibility is **not a priority** (wind is better captured by a local weather station).

### Weather station
Place it where it reflects **field conditions** (not sheltered, not heat-soaked), while staying safe and permitted.

**Wind sampling matters:** whenever possible, mount the weather sensor in a spot with **unobstructed wind exposure**—ideally **at the top of a pole, building, or other approved structure**.

**Rule of thumb:** avoid sheltered corners, heat sources, and obstructions that can mislead wind and temperature readings.

## Safety-first rules of thumb
- Coordinate with the airport sponsor/manager. Ask: “Where are objects allowed?”
- Stay well clear of **runway/taxiway safety areas** and any “keep clear” areas the airport identifies.
- Prefer existing structures when possible.
- Avoid anything that would become a hazard if it failed (fell, loosened, got struck).

## Decision points that affect everything else
Your location choice will determine:
- whether maintenance access needs an escort (escort is OK; just plan for it)
- whether grid power/PoE is possible (or solar/battery is required)
- whether a LAN connection is available (or a wireless/LTE path is needed)
- how hard maintenance will be (and whether it’s realistic for volunteers)

## Stop conditions
Pause and re-plan if you can’t get a view that is **useful**, **safe**, and **maintainable**.

## Common failure modes (and what to do)
These aren’t dead ends—this is often the moment to ask for help or change the plan.

- **View is great, but power/internet isn’t realistic:** pause and ask the airport sponsor/manager (or local community) about options: PoE from a nearby building, a short conduit run, a point‑to‑point link, a local WISP, or LTE.
- **Placement is safe, but the view is misleading:** blocked horizon, sheltered microclimate, heat soak, or an angle that hides the real sky/visibility story. Try a different location or add a second “wide sky” camera.

## Common location patterns (fast guidance)
- **Existing pole/structure:** often simplest (if safe and approved)
- **Building mount:** good when it gives access to power/internet and safe mounting
- **Permanent ground mount:** best when you need height and permanence, but higher review/effort
- **Temporary ground mount:** useful for pilots/remote fields and “try before you commit,” but must still be safe and permitted

(Guide 03 will go deeper on each.)

## When extra review may be needed (when in doubt, ask)
If you’re proposing a new tall structure or significant new height, pause and ask the airport sponsor/manager what process they prefer.
Some projects may require FAA airspace notification/review depending on height and location.
We’ll cover this with links and a practical checklist in a dedicated legal/safety section later in the guide series.

# Airport Site Survey Checklist (Template)

Use this checklist to evaluate **2–5 candidate locations** before you mount anything.

## 0) Before you go (10 minutes)
- Confirm **who the decision maker is** (airport sponsor/owner or manager) and how to reach them on site
- Bring a simple sketch/map (even a printed satellite view) and a way to take photos
- Bring a ladder plan (or confirm you can access roof/pole safely with permission)
- If you’re considering LTE: bring a phone on the intended carrier(s) to check signal
- Know your goal: *runway + sky cues* first, optional extra views second

## 1) Goals (what “good” looks like)
### Camera goals
- If you have only **one camera**, prioritize aiming **down the primary approach runway**.
- Frame guideline: **~50% (or less) ground** and **~50% sky** so the image supports both runway condition and sky/visibility cues.
- If you can only get *either* runway or sky, choose **sky + runway axis cues** over ramp detail.
- Include **geographic reference points** (mountains/hills/ridges/landmarks) when possible to help approximate visibility distance and cloud height.
- Show runway condition cues (wet, snow, standing water, glare) and sky condition cues (fog layers, cloud bases, visibility trends).
- Windsock visibility is **optional** (a local weather station is preferred for wind).

### Weather station goals
- Readings should reflect **field conditions**, not a sheltered corner
- Avoid obvious local distortion (heat sources, roof turbulence, obstructions)

## 2) Stakeholders and permission
- Airport sponsor/owner:
- Airport manager:
- Key tenants (FBO/flight school):
- Off-airport landowner (if needed):

**Written permission:** ☐ yes ☐ pending ☐ no

## 3) Candidate locations (list 2–5)
For each candidate location, capture the fields below.

### Location A (name it)
**Type:** ☐ existing pole/structure ☐ building mount ☐ permanent ground ☐ temporary ground  
**Approx. height:**  
**Who controls this site (owner/tenant):**  
**Maintenance access:** ☐ easy ☐ moderate ☐ hard (describe)  
**Escort required (OK):** ☐ no ☐ yes  
**Safety notes from airport authority:**  

#### Camera view notes
- What it sees (runway axis + approach cues, sky split, landmarks for visibility/cloud cues):
- Sun/glare risk (morning/afternoon):
- Vibration/wind exposure risk:
- Tamper/theft risk:

#### Power + internet feasibility
- Power available: ☐ grid ☐ PoE ☐ solar/battery needed ☐ unknown
- Internet available: ☐ LAN/broadband ☐ Wi‑Fi bridge ☐ point‑to‑point ☐ LTE/5G ☐ Starlink ☐ unknown
- Notes (cable route, conduit, trenching avoidance, equipment enclosure):

#### Quick scoring (weighted)
- **View usefulness (runway axis + sky + landmarks):** 1–10  
- Weather representativeness: 1–5  
- Safety / non‑hazard: 1–5  
- Maintenance access: 1–5  
- Power + internet feasibility: 1–5  
- **Total (out of 30):**

**Why the weighting?** The primary reason the camera exists is the view. Everything else supports whether that view is safe, feasible, and sustainable.

#### Photos / sketch
Attach:
- Photo facing camera direction
- Photo of mounting surface/pole
- A simple sketch showing where it sits and where it points

(Repeat for Location B/C/D/E)

## 4) Safety-first placement (plain language)
This project exists to improve safety. The last thing we want is to create a new hazard.

- Ask the airport sponsor/manager where objects are allowed and where they are not.
- Stay well clear of **runway and taxiway safety areas** and any “keep clear” areas the airport identifies.
- Prefer existing structures where possible.
- If you can’t place it safely, **don’t install**.

## 5) When extra review may be needed (simple trigger list)
If any of these are true, pause and ask the airport sponsor/manager what process they prefer:
- You’re proposing a **new pole/tower** or significant new height
- It’s close enough that it could be considered an “obstruction” to air navigation
- You’re unsure whether FAA airspace notification applies

(Your later guide will explain the common FAA notification path and provide links.)

## 6) Decision
- **Chosen location:**  
- **Backup location:**  
- Why (2–3 bullets):

## 7) Next steps
- Confirm written permission and access plan
- Choose mounting approach (Guide 03)
- Choose power (Guide 05) and internet (Guide 06)
- Confirm equipment list (Guide 07)
- Schedule install + maintenance owner
