# AviationWX Airport Installation Guides

These guides help airport sponsors, volunteers, pilots, and community groups set up **weather and runway observations** (cameras + weather stations) and publish them through AviationWX.

They are written to be approachable for non-technical readers, while still giving enough detail to do safe, reliable installs.

## What AviationWX is (plain language)
AviationWX provides a clean, fast dashboard for each airport that focuses on the most practical “right now” information:
- one or more still-image views (updated every 1-15 minutes)
- local weather data (official sources when available, plus on-site sensors when helpful)

This is a **supplemental** source of information and does not replace official briefings or official airport equipment.

## Open source and portability
AviationWX is open source. Airports and local groups are not locked into a proprietary solution:
- participate in the shared AviationWX network, or
- self-host and continue using your equipment independently.

## Contributing
If you spot an improvement, open a GitHub issue or PR:
- keep language plain and pilot-friendly
- prefer checklists
- avoid duplicating the same policy text across multiple guides
