# Airport Site Survey Checklist (Template)

Use this checklist to evaluate **2–5 candidate locations** before you mount anything.

## 0) Before you go (10 minutes)
- Confirm **who the decision maker is** (airport sponsor/owner or manager) and how to reach them on site
- Bring a simple sketch/map (even a printed satellite view) and a way to take photos
- Bring a ladder plan (or confirm you can access roof/pole safely with permission)
- If you’re considering LTE: bring a phone on the intended carrier(s) to check signal
- Know your goal: *runway + sky cues* first, optional extra views second

## 1) Goals (what “good” looks like)
### Camera goals
- If you have only **one camera**, prioritize aiming **down the primary approach runway**.
- Frame guideline: **~50% (or less) ground** and **~50% sky** so the image supports both runway condition and sky/visibility cues.
- If you can only get *either* runway or sky, choose **sky + runway axis cues** over ramp detail.
- Include **geographic reference points** (mountains/hills/ridges/landmarks) when possible to help approximate visibility distance and cloud height.
- Show runway condition cues (wet, snow, standing water, glare) and sky condition cues (fog layers, cloud bases, visibility trends).
- Windsock visibility is **optional** (a local weather station is preferred for wind).

### Weather station goals
- Readings should reflect **field conditions**, not a sheltered corner
- For wind, prefer **unobstructed exposure**—ideally mounting the sensor **at the top of an approved pole, building, or structure**
- Avoid obvious local distortion (heat sources, roof turbulence, obstructions)

## 2) Stakeholders and permission
- Airport sponsor/owner:
- Airport manager:
- Key tenants (FBO/flight school):
- Off-airport landowner (if needed):

**Written permission:** ☐ yes ☐ pending ☐ no

## 3) Candidate locations (list 2–5)
For each candidate location, capture the fields below.

### Location A (name it)
**Type:** ☐ existing pole/structure ☐ building mount ☐ permanent ground ☐ temporary ground  
**Approx. height:**  
**Who controls this site (owner/tenant):**  
**Maintenance access:** ☐ easy ☐ moderate ☐ hard (describe)  
**Escort required (OK):** ☐ no ☐ yes  
**Safety notes from airport authority:**  

#### Camera view notes
- What it sees (runway axis + approach cues, sky split, landmarks for visibility/cloud cues):
- Sun/glare risk (morning/afternoon):
- Vibration/wind exposure risk:
- Tamper/theft risk:

#### Power + internet feasibility
- Power available: ☐ grid ☐ PoE ☐ solar/battery needed ☐ unknown
- Internet available: ☐ LAN/broadband ☐ Wi‑Fi bridge ☐ point‑to‑point ☐ LTE/5G ☐ Starlink ☐ unknown
- Notes (cable route, conduit, trenching avoidance, equipment enclosure):

#### Quick scoring (weighted)
- **View usefulness (runway axis + sky + landmarks):** 1–10  
- Weather representativeness: 1–5  
- Safety / non‑hazard: 1–5  
- Maintenance access: 1–5  
- Power + internet feasibility: 1–5  
- **Total (out of 30):**

**Why the weighting?** The primary reason the camera exists is the view. Everything else supports whether that view is safe, feasible, and sustainable.

#### Photos / sketch
Attach:
- Photo facing camera direction
- Photo of mounting surface/pole
- A simple sketch showing where it sits and where it points

(Repeat for Location B/C/D/E)

## 4) Safety-first placement (plain language)
This project exists to improve safety. The last thing we want is to create a new hazard.

- Ask the airport sponsor/manager where objects are allowed and where they are not.
- Stay well clear of **runway and taxiway safety areas** and any “keep clear” areas the airport identifies.
- Prefer existing structures where possible.
- If you can’t place it safely, **don’t install**.

## 5) When extra review may be needed (simple trigger list)
If any of these are true, pause and ask the airport sponsor/manager what process they prefer:
- You’re proposing a **new pole/tower** or significant new height
- It’s close enough that it could be considered an “obstruction” to air navigation
- You’re unsure whether FAA airspace notification applies

(Your later guide will explain the common FAA notification path and provide links.)

## 6) Decision
- **Chosen location:**  
- **Backup location:**  
- Why (2–3 bullets):

## 7) Next steps
- Confirm written permission and access plan
- Choose mounting approach (Guide 03)
- Choose power (Guide 05) and internet (Guide 06)
- Confirm equipment list (Guide 07)
- Schedule install + maintenance owner
