# 04 - Safety, Legal, and Compliance References (FAA + Codes)

This guide is a “deep links + plain-English” reference for the most common safety and compliance topics that come up when installing **weather and runway observation equipment** (cameras + weather sensors) at an airport.

**This is not legal advice.** Airports vary widely. When in doubt, involve the airport sponsor/manager and (if applicable) your state aviation agency and FAA contacts.

If you’re new to this project, start with **Guide 01 - Permission Packet** first.

---

## The short version (what to do first)
1. **Get permission** from the airport owner/sponsor (or their designated stewardship group).  
2. **Pick a safe location** that doesn’t create hazards and produces reliable data (Guide 02 + Guide 03).  
3. **Ask one key question:** *Does this installation require FAA/State notice or review (Part 77 / 7460-1 / ALP)?*  
4. **Install safely** (work plan + escort if needed; avoid runway/taxiway safety areas; treat trenches and ladders as hazards).  
5. **Validate and monitor** after install (Guide 12 submission + review).

## “Pick your path” decision tree

### Path A - “No new structure, no new height” (lowest friction)
Examples:
- Mounting a camera to an existing building
- Adding equipment to an existing pole **without increasing overall height**
- Using an existing, approved mounting point

Still do:
- Permission + site survey + safe work practices
- Confirm you’re not creating a hazard in safety areas (see Airport Design references below)

### Path B - “New pole / tower / mast” or “meaningful increase in height”
Examples:
- A new ground-mounted pole
- Any new equipment that increases the structure height, or changes what’s on top

Do:
- Ask the airport sponsor if an **FAA airspace notice** is required (Part 77 / 7460-1)
- If yes, file through **OE/AAA** and coordinate with state aviation agencies (example: Oregon)

### Path C - “Work on or near movement areas” (runway/taxiway environments)
Examples:
- You need to cross a taxiway, work near runway edges, or stage a lift near operational surfaces

Do:
- Treat it like a “construction safety” activity: have an escort if required, create a simple safety plan, coordinate times, use markings/barricades when appropriate.
- Reference AC 150/5370-2G (Construction Safety and Phasing Plan guidance)

## Major FAA references (what they are + why they matter)

### 1) 14 CFR Part 77 - “Do we have to notify the FAA about this structure?”
**What it is:** Federal rules on the safe, efficient use and preservation of navigable airspace, including when you must **notify the FAA** about a proposed structure or alteration.  
**Why it matters:** Even a well-intentioned pole can become an airspace issue if it penetrates certain surfaces or thresholds near airports.

Links:
- Part 77 (eCFR): https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-E/part-77
- FAA “Part 77 notification” explainer: https://www.faa.gov/airports/central/engineering/part77

### 2) FAA Form 7460-1 - Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration
**What it is:** The form used to notify the FAA when Part 77 requires notice (or when FAA requests it).  
**Why it matters:** This is the most common “trigger” for FAA review of a new structure near an airport.

Links:
- FAA Form 7460-1 landing page: https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentid/186273
- PDF of FAA Form 7460-1: https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Form/FAA_Form_7460-1_042023.pdf

### 3) OE/AAA - FAA Obstruction Evaluation / Airport Airspace Analysis portal
**What it is:** The FAA’s online system used to submit and track 7460-1 filings and the resulting aeronautical study.  
**Why it matters:** If a notice is required, this is the “source of truth” system.

Link:
- OE/AAA Portal: https://oeaaa.faa.gov/

### 4) Airport Layout Plans (ALP) - “Does this need to be on the airport’s plan?”
**What it is:** The Airport Layout Plan is the airport’s planning “blueprint” showing existing and planned facilities. Many airports coordinate development via the ALP process, especially if federally obligated or receiving funding.  
**Why it matters:** A new structure (or certain changes) may need to be reflected on the ALP, and airport sponsors may need FAA coordination through their Airports District Office (ADO).

Links:
- ARP SOP 2.00 (FAA ALP review/approval procedures): https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/airports/resources/sops/arp-SOP-200-ALP-Review.pdf
- FAA “ALP approval preliminary instructions” (Reauthorization-era guidance): https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/alp-approval-preliminary-instructions

> Practical takeaway: **Don’t try to “self-decide” ALP impacts.** Ask the airport sponsor/manager what their normal process is and who their FAA contact is.

## Airport geometry & safety areas (the “don’t create hazards” portion)

### 5) AC 150/5300-13B - Airport Design
**What it is:** The FAA’s main design standard for civil airports (runways, taxiways, aprons, and the safety areas around them).  
**Why it matters:** It defines concepts like **Runway Safety Area (RSA)** and **Runway Object Free Area (ROFA)** and runway protection zones. Even at small GA airports, it’s the most common “reference language” used by airport managers and consultants.

Links:
- AC 150/5300-13B page: https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentnumber/150_5300-13
- AC 150/5300-13B (PDF): https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC-150-5300-13B-Airport-Design-Chg1-w-errata.pdf

**Plain language summary:**  
- Airports have **keep-clear areas** near runways and taxiways so that aircraft can operate safely even if they veer off the pavement or need room for wings/props/jet blast.  
- Your installation should not add objects in those areas. If you’re unsure, the airport sponsor/manager can tell you where their RSAs/ROFAs and other critical areas are.

> AviationWX guidance: we’d rather choose a slightly “less perfect” mount than place equipment where it creates hazard exposure.

## Marking/lighting & visibility (when structures must be made conspicuous)

### 6) AC 70/7460-1M - Obstruction Marking and Lighting
**What it is:** FAA guidance on how to mark/light structures that have been determined to be an obstruction or hazard to air navigation.  
**Why it matters:** If FAA (or the airport) determines marking/lighting is needed, this is the standard reference.

Links:
- AC 70/7460-1M page: https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentnumber/70_7460-1
- AC 70/7460-1M (PDF): https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/Advisory_Circular_70_7460_1M.pdf
- AC 70/7460-1M Change 1 (PDF): https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_70-7460-1M_Change_1.pdf

**Plain language summary:**  
- If a structure could be hard to see (especially at night) and is near flight paths, marking/lighting may be required.  
- AviationWX installs usually aim to be **low-profile**, but any new pole/tower needs a safety review mindset.

## Construction safety (even for “small” installs)

### 7) AC 150/5370-2G - Operational Safety on Airports During Construction (CSPP)
**What it is:** FAA guidance for maintaining operational safety during construction, including checklists and expectations for a **Construction Safety and Phasing Plan (CSPP)**.  
**Why it matters:** Even a small equipment install can create hazards: open trenches, equipment staged near taxiways, unmarked holes, ladders in windy conditions, etc. This AC provides a proven framework.

Links:
- AC 150/5370-2G page: https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentnumber/150_5370-2
- AC 150/5370-2G (PDF): https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150-5370-2G.pdf

**Plain language summary:**  
- Plan your work so you’re not improvising next to aircraft operations.  
- Coordinate times/areas, use barricades/markings as required, and do daily “is anything unsafe?” checks.

> AviationWX practice: if an airport wants an escort for safety, that’s normal-plan for it.

## (Optional) Part 139 airports (certificated airports)
Most small GA airports are **not** Part 139, but some airports you encounter may be.

**What it is:** Part 139 governs FAA certification and operational safety requirements for certain airports.  
**Why it matters:** Part 139 airports typically have more formal processes for safety, construction coordination, and airfield operations.

Links:
- Part 139 overview (FAA): https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert
- “What is Part 139?” (FAA): https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/what-is-part-139
- Part 139 (Cornell Law): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/part-139

## National “codes” you should know (non-FAA, but highly relevant)

### 8) NFPA 70 - National Electrical Code (NEC)
**What it is:** The benchmark safety standard for electrical installations and inspection.  
**Why it matters:** Outdoor power, grounding, trenching, and building entry points are where projects get unsafe fast.

Links:
- NFPA 70 overview: https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/nfpa-70-standard-development/70
- Free online read-only access to NFPA standards: https://www.nfpa.org/for-professionals/codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/free-access

### 9) NFPA 780 - Lightning Protection Systems
**What it is:** A standard describing lightning protection installation requirements (air terminals, bonding, grounding, surge protection, etc.).  
**Why it matters:** Poles + rooftop mounts + long cables can increase lightning exposure. Mitigations are part of “do no harm.”

Links:
- NFPA 780 overview: https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/nfpa-780-standard-development/780
- NFPA 780 product page: https://www.nfpa.org/product/nfpa-780-standard-for-the-installation-of-lightning-protection-systems/p0780code

> Practical takeaway: “Grounding before entering a building” is not just a nice-to-have-it’s a safety principle.

### 10) FCC rules for unlicensed wireless (if you’re using Wi‑Fi / point‑to‑point links)
**What it is:** FCC rules for radio frequency devices operating without an individual license (common for Wi‑Fi, many point‑to‑point radios, etc.).  
**Why it matters:** Use certified equipment, install it as intended, and don’t create interference issues for others.

Links:
- 47 CFR Part 15 (eCFR): https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15
- 47 CFR Part 15 (Cornell Law): https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/part-15

## State & local considerations (example: Oregon)
Many states have their own aviation review/notification workflows that run alongside FAA processes.

Example (Oregon):
- Oregon Department of Aviation “Airspace and Tall Structures”: https://www.oregon.gov/aviation/doing-business-with-odav/pages/tall-structures.aspx

**Plain language summary:**  
- State agencies often want the same airspace notice info, and they can help guide sponsors through the process.

---

## Recommended “compliance-friendly” workflow for AviationWX installs
1. **Start with the Permission Packet** (Guide 01). Include who maintains the equipment and the removal plan.  
2. **Site survey** (Guide 02): choose candidate locations; capture photos; note approximate heights.  
3. **Ask the airport sponsor/manager:**  
   - “Is this considered a new structure or height change?”  
   - “Do you want/need a Part 77 (7460-1) filing?”  
   - “Does this belong on the ALP or require ADO coordination?”  
4. **If filing is needed**, file via **OE/AAA** and follow sponsor/state instructions.  
5. **Install with a safety mindset**: escort if required; stage equipment away from operations; avoid creating holes/trenches/hazards.  
6. **Submit to AviationWX for review** (Guide 12). We'll validate camera usefulness, data quality, and reliability.
