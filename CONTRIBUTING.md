   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**:

## Coding Standards

### PHP Code Style

- Use PSR-12 coding standards where applicable
- Add docblocks for functions and classes:
  ```php
  /**
   * Brief description
   * 
   * @param type $param Description
   * @return type Description
   */
  ```
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Security Guidelines

- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, credentials)
- Use `airports.json.example` as a template
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Follow security best practices in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation files for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Keep code examples in documentation accurate

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code works** and doesn't break existing functionality
2. **Update documentation** for any changes that affect users or developers
3. **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
4. **Write clear commit messages**:
   ```
   Short summary (50 chars or less)
   
   More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
   Explain what and why vs. how.
   ```

5. **Respond to feedback** promptly and professionally
6. **Wait for review** before merging (even if you have write access)
