## Why This Guide is Deprecated

This guide was written for the old PHP-based local testing approach. The project now uses Docker for consistent development and deployment.

**Use these guides instead**:

1. **[LOCAL_SETUP.md](LOCAL_SETUP.md)** - Complete Docker-based local development setup
2. **[PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md](PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Step-by-step Ubuntu LTS VPS deployment
3. **[DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Detailed deployment and CI/CD guide

## Legacy Content (For Reference Only)

The original content from this file has been merged into the guides above. If you need information about the old PHP-based setup, see [LOCAL_COMMANDS.md](LOCAL_COMMANDS.md).
