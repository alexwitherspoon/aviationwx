# Cron Heartbeat - Runs every minute
# Logs a heartbeat message to confirm cron daemon is running and executing jobs
# This helps monitor cron health and detect when cron stops working
# Logs to /var/log/aviationwx/ (logrotate handles rotation: 7 days, 100MB max)

# Scheduler Health Check - Runs every minute
# Validates scheduler daemon is running and healthy, restarts if needed.
# The scheduler daemon handles all weather and webcam updates (replaces cron-based fetching).

# Push Webcam Processor - Runs every minute

# Cache Cleanup - Runs daily at 4 AM
# Two-layer cleanup strategy (belt and suspenders):
# - Layer 1: Primary cleanup for files without automatic cleanup (rate limits, error files)
# - Layer 2: Backup cleanup as safety net for files that should have auto-cleanup
# - Layer 3: Orphan cleanup for removed airports
# Logs to /var/log/aviationwx/ via aviationwx_log() function.

# Let's Encrypt Certificate Renewal - Runs weekly (Sunday at 3 AM)
# Renews wildcard SSL certificates (aviationwx.org, *.aviationwx.org) if they're expiring soon.
# After renewal, enables SSL/TLS in vsftpd if certificates are available.
# Note: This is a fallback mechanism. Primary renewal should be via systemd timer on host.
# Errors are logged but don't fail the container (|| true).
