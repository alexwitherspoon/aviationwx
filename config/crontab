# AviationWX Cron Jobs
# Runs inside Docker container

# Set PATH for cron jobs (cron has minimal PATH by default)
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# Disable mail output (send to /dev/null) - we want output in Docker logs instead

# Set environment variables for cron jobs (cron doesn't inherit container env by default)
# CONFIG_PATH is critical for scripts to find airports.json

# Cron Heartbeat - Runs every minute
# Logs a heartbeat message to confirm cron daemon is running and executing jobs
# This helps monitor cron health and detect when cron stops working
# Writes to file-based log (logrotate handles rotation: 7 days, 100MB max)
# Runs as www-data to match other cron jobs (root cron jobs may not execute reliably on macOS Docker)
# Uses PHP script like other cron jobs for consistency and reliability

# Webcam Image Fetcher - Runs every minute
# Fetches webcam images from configured sources (MJPEG streams, RTSP, static images)
# and caches them for serving via the webcam API. Skips cameras with fresh cache.
# Logs to file-based log (logrotate handles rotation: 7 days, 100MB max)
# Also forwards to Docker logs for convenience (tee to both locations)

# Weather Data Fetcher - Runs every minute
# Refreshes weather cache for all configured airports by calling the weather API endpoint.
# Ensures weather data stays fresh for display on airport pages.
# Logs to file-based log (logrotate handles rotation: 7 days, 100MB max)
# Also forwards to Docker logs for convenience (tee to both locations)

# Push Webcam Processor - Runs every minute
# Processes webcam images uploaded via SFTP/FTP/FTPS by push cameras.
# Moves uploaded images from uploads directory to cache directory for serving.
# Logs to file-based log (logrotate handles rotation: 7 days, 100MB max)
# Also forwards to Docker logs for convenience (tee to both locations)

# Let's Encrypt Certificate Renewal - Runs weekly (Sunday at 3 AM)
# Renews wildcard SSL certificates (aviationwx.org, *.aviationwx.org) if they're expiring soon.
# After renewal, enables SSL/TLS in vsftpd if certificates are available.
# Note: This is a fallback mechanism. Primary renewal should be via systemd timer on host.
# Errors are logged but don't fail the container (|| true).
